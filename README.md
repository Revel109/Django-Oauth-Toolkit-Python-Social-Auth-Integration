# Django-Oauth-Toolkit-Python-Social-Auth-Integration
REST Framework + Django OAuth Toolkit + Python Social Auth integration

A solution for the common problem of making Django OAuth Toolkit working with Python Social Auth.

The trick is to register/sign in users from third parties access tokens and hooking up in the process to create your own access token and return it as JSON.

Feel free to create pull requests if you have a better solution!
